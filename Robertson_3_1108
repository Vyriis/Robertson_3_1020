I used two old band songs in my project. I modified my code by editing these songs to sound different from the original. I changed the speed of the songs and also some notes and pitches. I also cut out some of the slower parts of the songs to make them sound more lively and fast paced. I went through several different variations of the songs until I found one that I liked.

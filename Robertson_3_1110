I learned that with coding, sometimes simple things can take a long time to code and some complex things can be really easy. I also learned that sometimes the error messages aren't very accurate. I got stuck because I was given an error message regarding my for loop even though the issue was with my temperature sensor. I also had to tweak some variables and create new ones because I had to keep changing a lot of values within my code.

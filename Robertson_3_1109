My project went through a lot of revision through trial and error. I modified my code to make the songs better when they didn't sound right. I knew from the first time I heard it play this it dodn't sound correct. I found that the same problem would keep occuring where the pause between notes wasn't quite right. I had to keep changing the value and testing it until it sounded correct.
